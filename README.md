- 👋 Hi, I’m Richard but everyone calls me by my middle name Matt.  I have about 10 years experience in Social Services and the Nursing profession.  I also served a 6 year stint in the army.  While walking to my car one day I ended up slipping on some ice and broke my ankles.  I taught myself Python, HTML, and CSS during this time because . . .  I was literally stuck in front of a computer with nothing else to do for three months!  Taking an interest in the subject I graduated from App Academy and found a valuable tool to continue my passion in life.    
- 👀 My passion is helping people. Technology is a tool that can be used for mass government surveillence, however, it also can be used to help deliver food for homeless families.  Like the internal combustion engine or nuclear power its a tool that can be utilized to improve or destroy our society.  To divide or help bring people together.                  
- 🌱 I’m currently exploring the concept of human computer interaction.  In many cases programs are not written from the users perspective.  
 This causes tech poor / time crunched nurses to commit medication errors. It also prevents individuals from successfully 
 navigating the procedures necessary to access social services / charitable assistance.  Even in the aftermath of COVID many individuals 
 still struggle with basic computer literacy.  We need to cater more to these individuals and assist when possible.  Everything from the user interface all the way to the backend needs to be purposely designed for someone who is not as comfortable with technology as we are.  
- 💞️ I’m looking to assist where needed on a version of indeed / career builder that caters to recently returned citizens.  It would have a better impact on reducing crime than an additional ten billion dollars spent on mass incarceration.  I currently manage a website based on the concept of mutual aid.  This enables people 
  to seek help for various reasons and receive help in turn.  Sort of a way to directly help people instead of donating money via gofundme or other intermediaries.    
- 📫 How to reach me simply email at richardbaine@gmail.com  Feel free to use my "business" email at efdeliveryservice@gmail.com if you feel like being different. I wear many hats and owning a small trucking company is one of them.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on making a somewhat professional readme for github for social networking purposes.  No person is an island.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Angular and Selenium.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on anything that can be used to help another person.  I am always willing to help any non-profit that needs assistance. 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with networking and mentorship.  Isaac Newton stated that he only saw further than other people because he was standing on the shoulders of giants.  I wish to help others but in order to do that I need help in turn.
