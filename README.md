## Guten Tag!

- üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Richard but everyone calls me by my middle name Matt.  I have about 10 years experience in Social Services and the nursing profession.  I also served a 6 year stint in the army.  While walking to my car one day I ended up slipping on some ice and broke my ankles.  I taught myself Python, HTML, and CSS during this time because . . .  I was literally stuck in front of a computer and could not move!  Taking an interest in the subject I graduated from App Academy and found a valuable tool to continue my passion in life.    
- üëÄ My passion is helping people. Technology is a tool that can be used for mass government surveillence, however, it also can be used to help deliver food for homeless families.  Like the internal combustion engine or nuclear power its a tool that can be utilized to improve or harm our society.  To divide or help bring people together.  I wish that the code that I write try to be with the intention of helping other people.  Anything from assisting a nonprofit to simply being a game to provide entertainment.                 
- üå± I‚Äôm currently exploring the concept of human computer interaction.  In many cases programs are not written from the users perspective.  
 This causes tech poor / time crunched nurses to commit medication errors. It also prevents individuals from successfully 
 navigating the procedures necessary to access social services / charitable assistance.  Even in the aftermath of COVID many individuals 
 still struggle with basic computer literacy.  We need to cater more to these individuals and assist when possible.  Everything from the user interface all the way to the backend needs to be purposely designed for someone who is not as comfortable with technology as we are.

- üíûÔ∏è I am particularly interested in helping people who are combatting injustices of any kind. The United States has the highest incarceration rate in the world.  We are also steadily freeing indivdiauls from DEATH ROW who were exonerated.  A nation that claims to be the land of freedom.  Anything from high stakes issues like this to a family being thrown onto the street by a greedy landlord.  Technology can be used to help both legal aid orgs and public defenders offices nationwide. To make this world a more fair place to live in.     
- üì´ How to reach me simply email at richardbaine@gmail.com  Feel free to use my "business" email at efdeliveryservice@gmail.com if you feel like being different. I wear many hats and owning a small trucking company is one of them.

- üî≠ I‚Äôm currently working on making a somewhat professional readme for github for social networking purposes.  No person is an island.
- üå± I‚Äôm currently figuring out how to use Selenium for some helpful purpose.
- üëØ I‚Äôm looking to collaborate on anything that can be used to help another person.  I am always willing to help any non-profit that needs assistance. 
- ü§î I‚Äôm looking for help with networking and mentorship.  Isaac Newton stated that he only saw further than other people because he was standing on the shoulders of giants.  I wish to find a giant that is willing to let me stand on him / her . . .
